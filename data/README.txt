Please note that the dataset can ONLY be used for research and education purposes. 

The fake reviews dataset is split into three files:
- reviews.json: Includes the fake and official reviews
- apps.json: Includes meta-data (e.g., price) of apps related to the reviews
- features.json: Includes the extracted machine learning features as described in the paper (e.g., length of reviews) and a label indicating if the review if as fake review (label = 1) or official review (label = 0).

If you use the dataset within your publication, please make sure you cite the original work correctly, as listed below:
